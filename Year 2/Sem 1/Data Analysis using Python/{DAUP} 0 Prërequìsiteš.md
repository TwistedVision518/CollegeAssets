## 1. Define low-level & high-level language

- **Low Level Language**
    
    These are languages written in binary code ( 0s & 1s ). It is the machine understandable language.
    

---

- **High Level Language**
    
    These are languages that are written in human understandable languages. Translators are used to convert these languages to low-level language for execution.

## 2. Discuss the different characteristics of Python

- Easy to use
    - Python is a really easy language to learn provided you know the English language.
- Massive set of inbuilt & external libraries
- Open Source
- Platform Independent
- Interpreted Language

## 3. What is the difference b/w Compiler & Interpreter

- **Compiler**
    - A compiler will translate all the high-level language code that you want executed into low-level language in one go & then executes it.
    - All the errors in the code will be shown at once

---

- **Interpreter**
    - An interpreter will translate the high-level language code that you want executed into low-level language & execute it line by line.
    - If an error is encountered, it stops the translation & throws an error in the specific line where the error occurred

## 4. Discuss different applications of Artificial Intelligence
                                      { HINT : Data Science, NLP, ML, DL }

- **Data Science**
- **Natural Language Processing ( NLP )**
    - NLP is a machine learning technology that gives computers the ability to comprehend human language.
    - It is used to analyse text & speech data

---

- **Machine Learning ( ML )**
    - ML  is to develop algorithms that use mathematical and statistical models to perform data analysis tasks without explicit instructions.
    - It process large amount of data to come to conclusions without the external input from a user ( other than the dataset )

---

- **Deep Learning ( DL )**
    - DL is a subset of ML, using multilayered  neural networks ( deep neural networks ), to simulate the complex decision-making power of the human brain.

## 5. Define any 2 advantages of Microsoft Excel

- Microsoft Excel can be used to view a large set of data in a single page that can be easily interpreted in rows & columns.
- It supports a lot of functions to simplify data analysis

## 6. Discuss Database Management System

- Database Management System is used to manage databases that contain a collection of tables.
- When we arrange all the tables in a proepr way using a software, that software is called DBMS
