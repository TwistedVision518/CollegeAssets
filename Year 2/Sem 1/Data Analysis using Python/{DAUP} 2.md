In the real world we need labelled date. The labelled data needs to be processed. In python there is a important library known as pandas which is used for processing labelled data.

The most useful data structure for data analysis is data frame.

**DDD** --> Data Structure, Data analysis and Data Frames.

Data Frames --> It is analogous to *table* in RDBMS. Its structure is the same as tables. It is a collection of rows and columns

### Basics of Data-frame

The *pandas* library is specially used for handling data of different dimensions.
Series is one dimensional data and Data-Frame is 2 dimensional labelled data holding any data type.

*Series* is one dimensional data and *data frame* is two dimensional labelled data holding any data type.

*Data Frame is the most commonly used pandas object* and is represented as a *two dimensional labeled data structure* with columns of different types it can be thought as a *table in RDBMS or a spreadsheet.* 

A data frame is *created* using a `Dataframe()`
